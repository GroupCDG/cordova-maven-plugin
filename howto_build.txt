cordova-maven-plugin
====================

Apache Cordova Maven Plugin requires the Cordova Command-Line tool to be installed in order to
perform the build.

To install the Cordova Command-Line tool, follow these steps:

1, Download and install Node.js from http://nodejs.org/. 
Following installation, you should be able to invoke node and npm on your command line. 
If desired, you may optionally use a tool such as nvm or nave to manage your Node.js installation.

2, Download and install a git client, if you don't already have one. 
Following installation, you should be able to invoke git on your command line. Even though you 
won't be using git manually, the CLI does use it behind-the-scenes to download some assets when 
creating a new project.

3. Install the cordova module using npm utility of Node.js. The cordova module will automatically 
be downloaded by the npm utility.

On OS X and Linux:

$ sudo npm install -g cordova

On OS X and Linux, prefixing the npm command with sudo may be necessary to install this development 
utility in otherwise restricted directories such as /usr/local/share. 
If you are using the optional nvm/nave tool or have write access to the install directory, you may 
be able to omit the sudo prefix. There are more tips available on using npm without sudo, if you 
desire to do that.

On Windows:

C:\>npm install -g cordova

The -g flag above tells npm to install cordova globally. Otherwise it will be installed in the 
node_modules subdirectory of the current working directory.

You may need to add the npm directory to your PATH in order to invoke globally installed npm modules. 
On Windows, npm can usually be found at C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\npm. On OS X and Linux it 
can usually be found at /usr/local/share/npm.

Following installation, you should be able to run cordova on the command line with no arguments and 
it should print help text.
